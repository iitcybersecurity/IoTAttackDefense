The simulations have been performed in Windows 10 environment,
using Oversim, an opensource simulation framework, built over Omnetpp.
Oversim & Omnetpp installation tutorial => http://www.oversim.org/wiki/OverSimInstall 

versions used in this project:
-Omnetpp 4.2.2
-Oversim 20121206
-Inet 20111118

After the installation and configuration phase all the repository files must be added to
the Oversim directory system (by replacing the old files). 
Archives in /simulations contain simulation input datasets and must be extracted before
performing the simulations. In /simulations is also present the omentpp.ini file 
where it is possible to set up the configuration (config MyApplicationConfKademlia).
